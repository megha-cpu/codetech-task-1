**DOMAIN**: MACHINE LEARNING

**DURATION**: 6 WEEEKS

**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

**üìù Task Overview**
This repository contains my implementation for Task 1 of the internship, which focuses on building, training, and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The objective of this task is to gain practical experience with one of the most interpretable and foundational machine learning algorithms‚ÄîDecision Trees‚Äîand apply it to a classification problem.

A decision tree is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It splits the dataset based on feature values and creates a structure that mimics human decision-making. This model is particularly useful due to its clarity and simplicity in understanding how predictions are made.

**üìä Dataset**
For this task, I used the [insert dataset name here, e.g., Iris, Titanic, etc.], a widely used dataset for classification problems. The dataset includes [briefly describe features and labels, e.g., "various measurements of flowers with their respective species labels"].

**üß† Model Building**
The notebook walks through the following steps in the decision tree pipeline:

_1.Data Loading and Exploration_

Imported the dataset and analyzed basic properties and class distributions.

Performed visualizations to understand feature relationships.

_2.Data Preprocessing_

Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values if any).

Encoded categorical variables and performed feature scaling if necessary.

Split the data into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio.

_3.Model Training_

Used Scikit-learn‚Äôs DecisionTreeClassifier to train a model.

Tuned hyperparameters like max_depth and criterion (gini/entropy).

_4.Model Evaluation_

Evaluated the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

Generated classification reports for detailed performance metrics.

_5.Model Visualization_

Visualized the final trained decision tree using sklearn.tree.plot_tree().

The visual clearly illustrates how the model splits data based on feature thresholds.

**üñº Output Visualization**
An image of the decision tree output has been included in the repository under the filename decision_tree_output.png (or your actual filename).
It provides a complete overview of the decision-making process and shows how features influence classification outcomes at each node.

**üìà Results & Analysis**
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test dataset.
Some important findings from the model analysis:

The feature [insert top feature name] was most impactful in early splits.

The tree depth was [insert value], and it included [insert number] leaf nodes.

The visual tree structure helped in interpreting how input features contributed to each prediction.

**üí° Conclusion**
This task successfully demonstrates the process of implementing and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn. By applying the model on a real dataset, performing proper preprocessing, tuning, and visualization, I was able to gain a strong practical understanding of supervised learning workflows and model interpretability.
